Note
====
* This is a demo DB Test which tests the four basic functions create, read, update and delete, i.e, CRUD of a dummy DB. It was tested on a local DB which I created on my machine. 
* The screenshot attached has the result which I got after running each test. 
* The test can be easily extended for testing any DB.
